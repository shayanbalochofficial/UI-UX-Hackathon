The project available at [https://shayan-hackathonproject-three.vercel.app/](https://shayan-hackathonproject-three.vercel.app/) is one I worked on during a hackathon. It was an exciting and intense experience, where the goal was to design and prototype a user-centered solution to a real-world issue from a Figma Template. For this hackathon, I focused on creating an app that incorporates UI/UX principles to improve user interaction and solve a pressing problem.

The project includes wireframes and mockups that showcase the app's flow and design, as well as the user journey. I used tools like Figma to create a functional prototype that emphasizes usability, accessibility, and visual appeal. The hackathon challenge pushed me to think creatively and work under time pressure, collaborating and iterating quickly to bring the idea to life.
